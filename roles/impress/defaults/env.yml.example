{# This file is an example env.yml.
 # Ansible will automatically copy its contents into env.yml the first time you provision.
 #
 # If you'd like to override these ENV variables, edit env.yml instead,
 # because env.yml is listed in .gitignore and therefore will *not* be included in your commits.
 #
 # (That is, if you want to use your own Stripe keys or something,
 #  you can safely use them in env.yml without committing them to the public repository.)
 #
 # (To trigger jinja2 processing, I'll ask for a {{ variable }}.)
